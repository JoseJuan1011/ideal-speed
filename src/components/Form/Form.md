# Form

This will be prepared, as the name says, to be a stateful component which handles the input from the user.

![Form with inputs for speed and track's length, including an action zone where the calculate and reset button are](./img/form.png)

**PD:** In the future I will add the validation checking, it's one of the TODOs either way in the [README](https://github.com/JoseJuan1011/ideal-speed/blob/main/README.md).
