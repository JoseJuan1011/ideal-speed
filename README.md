Ideal Speed it's a web app prepared to show you the differences of time between different speeds.

## Objective
Create an app which raise awareness of speeding, and a tool for truck drivers to calculate how many minutes they need to reach their destination, between other uses.

**PD**: The app will be prepared for cases were the speed limit it's uniform along the length of the track.

## TODOs:
* Add State Management to the form, so it can interact with the chart.
* Add Feature where there can be more than 1 Line in the charts and with unique colors.
