# ideal-speed

Ideal Speed it's a web app prepared to show you the differences of time between different speeds.

## Objective

Create an app which raise awareness of speeding, and a tool for truck drivers to calculate how many minutes they need to reach their destination, between other uses.

**PD**: The app will be prepared for cases were the speed limit it's uniform along the length of the track.

## TODOs

* Fix bug with [Charts](https://github.com/JoseJuan1011/ideal-speed/tree/state-management/src/components/Chart) Component, where the component itself doesn't update after further state change.
* Add tests for better understanding of the application.
